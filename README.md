# 🌐 3D Visualizations with Three.js and WebGL

This project is a collaborative effort between three members, each focusing on a different interactive 3D application using **Three.js**, **WebGL**, and **Vite** as the development server. The project is structured as a multi-page web application, with a single landing page to navigate to each module.

## 🚀 Live Overview

- **Landing Page:** A central hub to access each demo.
- **Vite:** Fast local development server with module support.
- **Three.js:** Used in all 3D applications for rendering and animation.
